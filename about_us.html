   <p class="prenata">She has been working in the profession for 12 years. Hairdressing is her greatest passion. She gained her first experience in a small Rzesz√≥w salon as a determined and ambitious teenager. That's when she began to dream about her own business. Over the next few years, she worked hard and trained to finally take a chance and open her own salon. Thanks to hard work and determination, she has achieved great success and the good reputation of the New Look salon and returning customers are the best example of this. She completed many trainings, courses and is up to date with the latest trends in hair styling. Her hair-cutting, dyeing and modeling techniques reflect the creative energy of her personality. Her recipe for success in the profession is to understand the real needs of the client and create a hairstyle that will not only meet his expectations, but also be practical on a daily basis.</p>
